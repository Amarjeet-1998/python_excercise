        "The main focus of this article is to introduce hypothesis testing and illustrate with a few examples in Python.  Whatever be the concept, its execution can be done easily with programming languages like Python. But, the most important part is drawing inference out of the output and it is highly recommended to know the math behind the executed code.\n",

        "Hypothesis testing is important in statistics because it gives statistical evidence to show the validity of the study. The null hypothesis states that there is no statistical significance exists between sets of data which implies that the population parameter will be equal to a hypothesized value. Usually, We state the alternative hypothesis which we want to prove. For a null hypothesis H0 and its complementary alternative hypothesis H1, there are 3 cases when the parametric value under H0 ≠ H1 or H0 < H1 or H0 > H1.\n",
